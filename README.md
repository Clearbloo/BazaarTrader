# Trading simulator
4 main components:
- Market which simulates stocks or uses real data
- Broker which calculates trades and updates the portfolio
- Portfolio (self explanatory)
- Trader which tells the broker which trades to make (manually or algorithmically) and increments the time (manually or automatically)
